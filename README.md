so ive recently realized theres about 0 documentation on roblox engines just tons of leaked code, so i just started writing it down myself. this is what i've figured out so far — if something's wrong or missing lmk and i'll fix it.

if this helps you out at all, drop a ⭐ or come hang in the discord: [discord.gg/JpeFatN8yn](https://discord.gg/JpeFatN8yn)
- note: this is based on the 2016 source leak i will try to update any methods i find to be out dated
